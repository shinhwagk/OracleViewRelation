This parameter allows DBAs to specify an offset for the AWR snapshot start time.</p>\n<p>This is a useful parameter to avoid CPU spikes from multiple instances all starting their AWR snapshots at the same time. If you have a large system with many instances on it (like many Exadata installations), and you are experiencing such CPU spikes, this parameter can be very useful.</p>\n<p>The parameter is specified in seconds. Normally, you set it to a value less than 3600. If you set the special value 1000000 (1,000,000), you get an automatic mode, in which the offset is based on the database name.</p>\n<p>The automatic mode is an effective way of getting a reasonable distribution of offset times when you have a very large number of instances running on the same node.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- class=\"section\" --></div>\n</div>\n<!-- class=\"ind\" --><!-- Start Footer -->\n</div>\n<!-- add extra wrapper close div-->" }
