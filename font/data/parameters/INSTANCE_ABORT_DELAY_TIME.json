It does not apply to a shutdown abort operation or any abort necessary to implement a user command.</p>\n<p>Setting this parameter to a value greater than 0 enables a DBA to take some actions before an abort occurs due to a fatal error. Note that since the instance is in a fatal state, the DBA should not be too ambitious with the actions taken because some processes and/ or resources may be corrupted or unavailable, making complex actions impossible. Oracle does not guarantee what it is possible when an instance is in this state. A message is written to the alert log when the delayed abort is initiated. The value will not apply in the case of PMON death.</p>\n<p>The larger the specified value, the longer the instance stays up, and the potential increases for other problems to occur. If you set this parameter, Oracle recommends setting it to a value between 0 and 60.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox-note\" id=\"GUID-F15A6EC9-1F4F-4DB7-9981-FFC1F181559F__GUID-C4D1BBCF-9019-4305-B530-E4D1F07612C4\">\n<p class=\"notep1\">Note:</p>\n<p>This initialization parameter is available starting with Oracle Database 12<span class=\"italic\">c</span> Release 2 (12.2.0.1).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- class=\"section\" --></div>\n</div>\n<!-- class=\"ind\" --><!-- Start Footer -->\n</div>\n<!-- add extra wrapper close div-->" }
