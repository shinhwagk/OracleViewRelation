This can falsely indicate to a transaction that its changes are persistent. Also, it can violate the durability of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions if the database shuts down unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>If the parameter is set to <code>FORCE_WAIT</code>, the default behavior (immediate flushing of the redo log buffer with wait) is used. If this is a system setting, the session level and transaction level options will be ignored. If this is a session level setting, the transaction level options will be ignored. If <code>COMMIT_WAIT</code> is altered after it has been set to <code>FORCE_WAIT</code>, then the <code>FORCE_WAIT</code> option is no longer valid.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- class=\"section\" --></div>\n</div>\n<!-- class=\"ind\" --><!-- Start Footer -->\n</div>\n<!-- add extra wrapper close div-->" }
